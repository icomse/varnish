# {varnish}: Template for The Carpentries Workbench <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align='right' alt='' width=120 />

[![varnish status badge](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev/badges/varnish)](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev)

This project is part of [The Carpentries
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench). It serves as a template
for Carpentries lessons adapted from [{pkgdown}]. There is no need to call this
package directly, it is installed via the [{sandpaper}] package.

The html templates use [mustache templating
language](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) while the CSS and
JavaScript are compiled and minified on GitHub Actions.

## Installation

To install this package, you can use our [R-universe repository](https://carpentries.r-universe.dev),
which is updated hourly. 

```r
install.packages("varnish", repos = "https://carpentries.r-universe.dev")
```

There is no need to call this package directly, [{sandpaper}] will detect it and
copy the styling and templates to your lesson website.

## CSS and JavaScript

The CSS and JavaScript used for the lessons are minified. Their sources live in
the [`source/`](source/) folder with directives to include their dependencies
(bootstrap, jquery, feather).

The minified versions are built via GitHub actions any time one of the source
files is changed. 

Instructions to build locally forthcoming.

## HTML Templates

We have customized the following templates:

 - [content-chapter] displays the episodes for the lessons
 - [content-syllabus] is the landing page for the lessons
 - [content-extra] is used for pages that are not chapters and do not need
   positional navigation
 - [head] contains the metadata and script loading
 - [navbar] is a bit of misnomer, but it contains the sidebar navigation
 - [header] contains metadata and favicons
 - [footer] contains navigation, credits, and JSON metadata
 - [layout] pulls everything together

### Parameters

At the moment, {varnish} uses a mix of global parameters provided in a YAML file
generated for {pkgdown} and parameters (both global and page-specific) passed
directly to `pkgdown::render_page()`. All of these parameters are provisioned
by {sandpaper}, but it should be noted that **this particular structure is
expected to change** as we move to systems such as quarto, which use pandoc
templates.

#### pkgdown

[{pkgdown}] provides the `{{ #site }}{{ root }}{{ /site }}` parameter by default,
which inserts the path to the root folder when viewed locally and inserts the
URL when viewed on a server.

#### YAML

These parameters are recorded in a workbench lesson under `site/_pkgdown.yaml`

```yaml
title: {{ title }} # needed to set the site title
home:
  title: Home
  strip_header: true
  description: ~
template:
  package: varnish
  params:
    time: {{ time }}
    source: {{ source }}
    branch: {{ branch }}
    contact: {{ contact }}
    license: {{ license }}
    handout: {{ handout }}
    cp: {{ cp }}
    lc: {{ lc }}
    dc: {{ dc }}
    swc: {{ swc }}
    carpentry: {{ carpentry }}
    carpentry_name: {{ carpentry_name }}
    carpentry_icon: {{ carpentry_icon }}
    life_cycle: {{ life_cycle }}
    pre_alpha: {{ pre_alpha }}
    alpha: {{ alpha }}
    beta: {{ beta }}
```

Each of these parameters can be accessed via the `{{ yaml }}` mustache context.
For example, this adds a paragraph describing the license provided that the
`{{ license }}` parameter is present in the yaml: 

```html
{{#yaml}}{{#license}}
<p>Materials licensed under <a href="{{#site}}{{root}}{{/site}}LICENSE.html">{{license}}</a> by the authors</p>
{{/license}}{{/yaml}}
```


#### Global

(TODO: write descriptions of these parameters)

#### Page-specific

 - `{{ instructor }}`: a boolean indicating instructor view
 - `{{ aio }}`: a boolean indicating that the aio page should be included
 - `{{ this_page }}`: The file-only HTML path of the current page (e.g. `index.html` or `introduction.html`).
 - `{{{ schedule }}}`: The HTML sidebar of the schedule of episodes. 
 - `{{{ resources }}}`: an additional part of the sidebar giving extra resource elements avaialable in mobile view.
